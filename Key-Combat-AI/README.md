# Key Combat AI

This repository contains the source code for **Key Combat AI**, a 2D card‑based roguelike game with rhythm combat. The game is built using plain HTML5 and vanilla JavaScript and is designed to be played offline.

## Features

- **Gacha‑inspired hero collection**: Collect hero cards and use duplicates to level them up with no cap.
- **Node‑based dungeon runs**: Navigate through a branching map of combat, elite, reward, shop, rest and gacha nodes.
- **Rhythm‑based combat**: Each hero is bound to a specific key; press keys in time to attack and hold to unleash ultimate abilities.
- **Meta‑progression**: Earn Demon Souls during runs and spend them in the Guild Hall to unlock new heroes and upgrades.
- **Data‑driven content**: All heroes, enemies, rooms and boons are defined in simple JavaScript data files in the `data` folder.
- **Offline‑ready**: Download the project and open `index.html` in a modern browser to play.

## Running the Game

1. **Download or clone this repository.**
2. Ensure the folder structure remains intact (the `index.html` file should be at the root with `js`, `data` and `assets` subfolders).
3. Double‑click `index.html` to open the game in your default browser.
4. If your browser blocks local resource loading, run a simple local server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

## Saving Progress

The game uses the browser’s `localStorage` to save your unlocked heroes, levels and Demon Souls. Your progress will persist across sessions in the same browser.

## Contributing

If you would like to extend the game, you can:

- Add new heroes or enemies by editing the files in the `data` folder.
- Expand the map generation logic and node types.
- Improve the combat rhythm system and visuals.
